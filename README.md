## Description
This project is a product of a practical assignement of one of our classes: [Databases](https://www.ua.pt/en/uc/2238) and the main idea behind it is to implement a games database with info about games, publishers, developers, platforms, reviews and others. Along that we also implemented an interface in c# to showcase the features and use cases of our system.
